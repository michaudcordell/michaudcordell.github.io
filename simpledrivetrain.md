SimpleDrivetrain is a python package that provides an easy way to define a drivetrain 
by the location and orientation of its motors, and calculate the desired velocities 
for each motor given the overall desired translational velocity and rotational 
velocities for the drivetrain. I developed this project to facilitate robot software 
development for the underwater robotics club at ASU.
