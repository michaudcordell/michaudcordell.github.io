I am Cordell Michaud, a second-year computer science student at Arizona State University. 
This site functions as a showcase of my completed and ongoing personal projects, 
as well as a blog for selected topics of interest to me.

My primary interests are in robotics (specifically computer vision and control systems), 
and game development.

You can find my public repositories at my Github profile: [michaudcordell](https://github.com/michaudcordell)
