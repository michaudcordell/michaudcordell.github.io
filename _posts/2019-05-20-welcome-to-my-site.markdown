Welcome to my personal site.

I will be using this site as a platform for hosting information about my personal software projects. 


You will find updates about in-progress developments in the form of blog posts, which will be displayed on the [Home](/) page.

You will find a listing of completed projects on the [Projects](/projects) page, with a short description and screenshots on each project page, accompanied by a link to the associated repository on Github.

Lastly, you will find information about me, such as my occupation, interests, and relevant links, on the [About](/about) page.


Thank you for visiting my site, and be sure to check out my [About](/about) page if you're looking to get in touch.
